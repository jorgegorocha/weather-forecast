The app is live for viewing purposes on http://jorgerocha.cloud4you.pt/#/search

If the desire is to build and run the app locally the following steps should be taken:

-Install npm if it's not already installed;
-Unzip WeatherForecast.zip;
-Run console as administrator on the folder root;
-Run the command "npm install"
-Install gulp globally if it's not already installed with the command "npm install -g gulp"
-Run the command "gulp"

This will build, test and run the application. 
You can now access http://localhost:8000/#/search to see the application running the source files and 
http://localhost:8080/#/search to see the application running the minified and deployed files.
